Here is the typical step-by-step.

* Buy SSL certificate for your domain
* Generate your CSR on your hosting control panel (please complete data such as server name, organization, email etc)
* Paste generated CSR to your SSL provider dashboard
* SSL provider will give you signed certificate
* Install the signed certificate on your hosting control panel
* If the SSL provider provides you with CA Bundle, or Intermediate Certificate, just install that using the CA Certificate tab (for Virtualmin case)
