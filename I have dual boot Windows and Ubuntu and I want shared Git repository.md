I have repository initially on Windows, then I install Ubuntu on the machine so it become dual-boot system.

I can read Windows 10 partition from Linux and I want to do shared Git repo from Ubuntu. But when I do `git status` it will show modified files.

Just read this to prevent that on Ubuntu https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/
