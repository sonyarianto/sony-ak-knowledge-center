HTTPS, TLS, and SSL

HTTPS stands for HTTP Secure, Hyper(t)ext Transfer Protocol Secure. The secure portion here comes from the encryption added to the requests sent and received by the browser. Currently, most browsers use the TLS protocol to provide encryption; TLS is sometimes referred to as SSL.
